# Tensorboard in fastai

Tensorboard is now supported by pytorch natively (since pytorch 1.1).

This repository shows how to create a custom callback to use tensorboard with the fastai library.

# How to use it

The demo notebook shows how to use the callback. It's only few lines of codes

# Prerequisites

- Pytorch 1.1
- Fastai v1
